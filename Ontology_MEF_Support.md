# MEF Support Ontology — Matrix Embedding Framework Support Ontology
**Acronym:** MEF Support Ontology  
**Version:** 0.0.1-beta
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05  

> 🚨 **IMPORTANT WARNING**: This document contains **ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES ONLY** (such as `technical`, `business`, `draft`, etc.) that are NOT mandatory taxonomies. The **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** is the only definitive source for organizational taxonomies.

---

## 1. Introduction

The **MEF Support Ontology** defines reference controlled vocabularies that can be used in UKI structures, serving as a starter set for organizations implementing the Matrix Embedding Framework.

This document provides illustrative examples of domains, types, relationships, and other structural elements that organizations can use as a starting point when configuring their own organizational MOC.

It is important to emphasize that these are **reference examples**, not mandatory taxonomies.

---

## 2. Terms and Definitions

- **Controlled Vocabularies**: Standardized term sets to ensure consistency
- **Starter Set**: Initial example set to facilitate implementation
- **Reference Domains**: Examples of organizational knowledge areas
- **UKI Types**: Structural categories of knowledge units
- **Ontological Relationships**: Semantic connections between UKIs
- **Severity Levels**: Impact classifications for changes
- **Lifecycle States**: Status progression of knowledge units

Cross-reference to **organizational MOC** for specific validated taxonomies.

## 3. Core Concepts

### Principle of Organizational Flexibility
All elements in this document are **configurable suggestions**:
- Organizations can use as foundation
- Can add specific elements
- Can modify or remove as needed
- Must define their own hierarchies in MOC

### Separation of Reference vs Implementation
- **This Document**: Illustrative examples and guidance
- **Organizational MOC**: Specific authoritative definitions
- **Implementations**: Must consult MOC, not this document

### Vocabulary Categories
This ontology covers five main categories:
- **Reference Domains**: Example knowledge areas
- **UKI Types**: Structural knowledge categories
- **Relationship Types**: Semantic connection types
- **Severity Levels**: Impact classification system
- **Lifecycle States**: Knowledge unit status progression

---

## 4. Normative Rules

> ⚠️ This section is **normative**.

### Reference Vocabulary Usage
- Organizations MAY use examples in this document as starting point
- Organizations MUST define their specific vocabularies in organizational MOC
- Systems MUST validate UKI fields against organizational MOC, not this document
- Implementations MUST treat this document as illustrative reference only

### Controlled Extensibility
- Vocabularies MAY be extended through organizational MOC
- Semantic validation MUST be centralized in MOC
- Changes MUST follow defined organizational governance process

### Validation Requirements
- Automated systems MUST validate UKI fields based on MOC-defined vocabularies
- All UKI field values MUST reference valid nodes in organizational MOC
- Cross-references between UKIs MUST be validated against MOC relationship rules

---

## 5. Interoperability

- **MEF (Matrix Embedding Framework)**: Uses vocabularies defined in organizational MOC
- **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)**: Authoritative source for all organizational vocabularies
- **ZOF (Zion Orchestration Framework)**: Consults vocabularies during EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint
- **OIF (Operator Intelligence Framework)**: Applies vocabularies in filtering and explanations

---

## 6. Conventions and Examples

All examples in this document are **illustrative only** and do not define normative behavior.  
Normative semantics (scopes, governance, archetypes, enrich criteria) are always derived from the **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** of each organization.  
Examples are provided for clarity and MAY be adapted to local contexts, but MUST NOT be treated as protocol-level obligations.
