# Matrix Protocol Beta

The **Matrix Protocol** is a comprehensive framework for human-AI collaboration through three interdependent layers:

- **ðŸ”® Oracle**: Strategic governance & knowledge base management (MEF)
- **âš¡ Zion**: Conceptual workflow framework for AI-oriented teams (ZOF)  
- **ðŸ§  Operator**: Practical execution and implementation by development teams (OIF)

## Epistemic Manifesto

The protocol is guided by the **Matrix Epistemic Principle (MEP)** â€” an accessible manifesto that establishes how knowledge is treated, evaluated, and promoted in the Matrix ecosystem.

## Frameworks

### MEF - Matrix Embedding Framework
Versioned knowledge structuring for organizational knowledge base management.

### ZOF - Zion Orchestration Framework
Conceptual workflows for AI-oriented teams with 7 canonical states.

### OIF - Operator Intelligence Framework
Artificial intelligence archetypes for practical execution.

### MOC - Matrix Ontology Catalog
Catalog of organizational hierarchies with structured taxonomies.

### MAL - Matrix Arbiter Layer
Conflict and concurrency arbitration with P1-P6 rules.
