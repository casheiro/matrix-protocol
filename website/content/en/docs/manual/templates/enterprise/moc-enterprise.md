# =============================================================================
# ENTERPRISE GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

implementation_notes:
  governance_structure: |
    1. Establish clear approval hierarchies aligned with org chart
    2. Implement formal change management processes
    3. Create compliance checkpoints at each maturity level
    4. Set up regular governance review cycles
    
  risk_management: |
    1. Classify knowledge by risk and compliance requirements
    2. Implement appropriate controls for each classification
    3. Regular risk assessments of knowledge processes
    4. Business continuity planning for critical knowledge
    
  change_management: |
    1. Executive sponsorship for Matrix Protocol implementation
    2. Formal training programs for all user levels
    3. Phased rollout by business unit
    4. Success metrics and continuous improvement
    
  common_challenges: |
    - Resistance to formal processes from technical teams
    - Complex approval chains slowing down innovation
    - Knowledge buried in compliance documentation
    - Difficulty balancing governance with agility
    
  scaling_signals: |
    Consider upgrading to Corporation template when:
    - You have 900+ employees
    - Multiple geographic regions
    - Complex regulatory environments
    - Board-level governance requirements
