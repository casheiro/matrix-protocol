# MOC Unified Structure - Normative Template
# Matrix Protocol v1.0 - Official specification compliance template
# THIS IS THE CANONICAL STRUCTURE - All MOCs MUST implement these 4 hierarchies

organization: "[ORGANIZATION_NAME] - UNIFIED STRUCTURE"
created_date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
last_modified: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
version: "1.0.0"
classification: "NORMATIVE"

# =============================================================================
# PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
# =============================================================================
compliance:
  matrix_protocol_version: "1.0.0"

# =============================================================================
# MANDATORY HIERARCHIES - These 4 hierarchies are REQUIRED for Matrix Protocol compliance
# =============================================================================

hierarchies:
  # HIERARCHY 1: SCOPE (MANDATORY) - Knowledge visibility and organizational reach
  scope:
    metadata:
      concept: "Knowledge reach and visibility within organizational structure"
      protocol_requirement: "MANDATORY"
      governance_rules: |
        Defines WHO can access knowledge and HOW it propagates through organization.
        MUST reflect actual organizational structure and authority boundaries.
        Supports MEP Semantic Elasticity - adapt levels to your org, keep concept universal.
      level_semantics: |
        Organizations MUST define what each level means in their context.
        Common patterns:
        - Breadth-based: Level 0 = broadest access, higher levels = more restricted
        - Depth-based: Level 0 = deepest/most specific, higher levels = broader scope
        - Hierarchical: Levels map to organizational hierarchy levels
        
        CHOOSE ONE pattern and apply consistently across ALL scope nodes.
