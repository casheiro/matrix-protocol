# =============================================================================
# SCALE-UP GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

implementation_notes:
  tribe_setup: |
    1. Organize tribes by business capability, not technology
    2. Ensure each tribe has clear ownership boundaries
    3. Set up regular cross-tribe communication channels
    4. Define escalation paths for cross-tribe decisions
    
  governance_evolution: |
    1. Start with lightweight processes and add structure as needed
    2. Balance autonomy with coordination requirements
    3. Implement approval chains for decisions affecting multiple tribes
    4. Create feedback loops to improve processes continuously
    
  common_challenges: |
    - Knowledge silos between tribes
    - Inconsistent processes across squads
    - Decision paralysis due to complex approval chains
    - Lack of visibility into other tribes' work
    
  scaling_signals: |
    Consider upgrading to Enterprise template when:
    - You have 180+ employees
    - Multiple business units are forming
    - Regulatory compliance becomes critical
    - Geographic distribution requires formal governance
