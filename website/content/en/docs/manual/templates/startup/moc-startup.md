# =============================================================================
# STARTUP GUIDELINES
# =============================================================================

implementation_notes:
  quick_start: |
    1. Start with 1-2 UKIs about recent important decisions
    2. Focus on preventing knowledge loss as you scale
    3. Keep processes lightweight and iterate quickly
    4. Use daily standups to reinforce UKI creation habits
    
  common_pitfalls: |
    - Don't over-engineer the taxonomy from the start
    - Don't make processes too heavy for startup pace
    - Don't skip knowledge capture during rapid growth phases
    - Don't forget to evolve the MOC as you scale
    
  scaling_signals: |
    Consider upgrading to Scale-up template when:
    - You have 40+ employees
    - Multiple distinct teams are forming
    - You need more formal governance processes
    - Cross-team coordination becomes challenging
