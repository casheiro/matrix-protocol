  ## TechCorp Design System Component Standards
  
  ### Core Principles
  1. **Consistency:** All user-facing components must use design system tokens
  2. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all components
  3. **Performance:** Component bundle size < 50KB gzipped
  4. **Documentation:** Every component requires usage examples and API docs
  
  ### Component Categories
  
  #### Atomic Components
  - Button variations (primary, secondary, destructive, ghost)
  - Input fields (text, email, password, search, textarea)
  - Icons (using TechCorp icon library v3.2+)
  - Typography elements (headings, body text, captions)
  
  #### Molecular Components  
  - Form groups (input + label + error message)
  - Card layouts (content cards, action cards, info cards)
  - Navigation elements (breadcrumbs, pagination, tabs)
  - Data display (tables, lists, key-value pairs)
  
  #### Organism Components
  - Header/navigation patterns
  - Footer patterns  
  - Form layouts (login, registration, checkout)
  - Dashboard layouts
  
  ### Implementation Requirements
  
  #### React Components
  ```typescript
  // All components must follow this interface pattern
  interface ComponentProps {
    className?: string;
    testId?: string;
    children?: React.ReactNode;
    // ... component-specific props
  }
  
  // Example implementation
  export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
    variant = 'primary',
    size = 'medium',
    disabled = false,
    children,
    testId = 'button',
    ...props
  }) => {
    return (
      <button 
        className={cn('tc-button', variant, size)}
        disabled={disabled}
        data-testid={testId}
        {...props}
      >
        {children}
      </button>
    );
  };
  ```
  
  #### Vue Components
  ```vue
  <!-- All Vue components must include proper TypeScript typing -->
  <template>
    <button 
      :class="buttonClasses" 
      :disabled="disabled"
      :data-testid="testId"
      @click="$emit('click', $event)"
    >
      <slot />
    </button>
  </template>
  
  <script setup lang="ts">
  interface Props {
    variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive' | 'ghost';
    size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    disabled?: boolean;
    testId?: string;
  }
  
  const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
    variant: 'primary',
    size: 'medium', 
    disabled: false,
    testId: 'button'
  });
  </script>
  ```
  
  ### Testing Requirements
  - Unit tests: 90%+ coverage for all components
  - Visual regression tests: Chromatic snapshots for all variations
  - Accessibility tests: Automated axe-core testing
  - Performance tests: Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
  
  ### Documentation Standards
  - Storybook stories for all component variations
  - Usage guidelines with do/don't examples
  - API documentation with TypeScript interfaces
  - Migration guides for breaking changes

examples:
  - input: "Frontend team needs to implement a new user registration form"
    output: "Team uses Button (primary), Input (text, email, password), Form Group molecular components following accessibility patterns. Form validation uses design system error patterns."
    
  - input: "Mobile app team building product listing page"
    output: "Team uses Card (content variant) organism, Typography (heading, body) atomic components, and Pagination molecular component. Mobile-specific spacing tokens applied."
    
  - input: "Design system component needs breaking API change"
    output: "Follow semantic versioning with MAJOR bump. Create migration guide. Provide 90-day deprecation notice. Update all consuming teams via Slack automation."

## üîÆ Future Evolution and Continuous Improvement

### Continuous Matrix Protocol Enhancement

TechCorp's Matrix Protocol implementation (hypothetical example) demonstrates how epistemological semantic protocols can structure organizational knowledge when implemented with proper planning, executive support, and gradual adoption.

This technical structuring and governance patterns demonstrate the potential of Matrix Protocol to formalize how organizations create, govern, and leverage knowledge in the era of human-AI collaboration.
