Slack Thread: #squad-payments - Topic: Refunds Policy

[10:23] maria.po: team, we got another complaint about refund timeframe. customer said 7 days is too short

[10:25] joao.techlead: our policy is 7 business days, right?

[10:26] ana.qa: yes, but competition gives more time. amazon gives 15 days, walmart 30

[10:45] pedro.senior: team, technically we can process in 2-3 days, the problem is manual process

[11:02] carlos.devops: current gateway is slow. stripe takes time, paypal is faster

[2 weeks later...]

[14:12] maria.po: guys, VIP customer wants 14 days. can I approve as exception?

[14:15] joao.techlead: we need to standardize this. different people saying different timeframes

[14:18] ana.qa: accounting team mentioned they follow 30 days for their reconciliation

[14:22] pedro.senior: but that's different process. we're talking about customer-facing refunds

[14:30] carlos.devops: what about international customers? their banks take longer

[15:45] maria.po: so what's the final rule? I have customer waiting

[15:47] joao.techlead: let's approve 14 days for VIP this time, but we need proper policy next sprint

[16:02] ana.qa: should I update the FAQ? what timeframe should I put?

[16:15] pedro.senior: maybe "7-14 business days depending on customer tier"?

[16:30] carlos.devops: that's too vague. customers won't like uncertainty

[2 days later...]

[09:15] maria.po: another complaint. customer says competitor promised instant refund for digital products

[09:18] joao.techlead: we don't even differentiate digital vs physical yet

[09:22] ana.qa: should we? that sounds complex

[09:45] pedro.senior: technically possible but need product owner approval

[10:30] carlos.devops: also affects taxes and accounting. not just technical change

[11:15] maria.po: meanwhile what do I tell customers? each agent is saying different things

[11:18] joao.techlead: use 7 days for now, escalate VIP to me

[11:30] ana.qa: documenting current state is a mess. we need proper knowledge base
