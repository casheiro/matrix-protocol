hierarchies:
  scope:
    metadata:
      concept: "Knowledge reach and visibility"
      governance_rules: |
        Defines the organizational reach and access control for knowledge.
        Squad-level knowledge can be promoted to tribe or organization levels
        based on validation and stakeholder approval.
      level_semantics: |
        For scope hierarchy: level represents organizational depth (0=root, 1=child, 2=grandchild).
        Lower level = broader organizational reach. Higher level = more specific scope.
        Used by MAL P2 for scope specificity evaluation.
