  ## Refund Request Deadline
  
  **Unified standard:** 14 calendar days from purchase date
  **Justification:** Alignment with competition and UX improvement
  **Exceptions:**
  - VIP customer (loyalty program): 30 calendar days
  - Digital products: 7 calendar days (non-reversible)
  
  ## Refund Processing by Gateway
  
  **Stripe:**
  - SLA: 3-5 business days
  - Partial refund: allowed (maximum 1x per transaction)
  - Automation: < $100 (automatic), >= $100 (manual approval)
  
  **PayPal:**  
  - SLA: 2-3 business days
  - Partial refund: allowed (no quantity limit)
  - Automation: < $200 (automatic), >= $200 (manual approval)
  
  ## Business Rules
  
  **Mandatory manual approval:**
  - Values >= $1,000.00 (any gateway)
  - Multiple refunds same customer (> 3 per month)
  - Suspected fraud or historical chargeback
  
  **Proportional refund:**
  - When discount applied, refund considers original value
  - Shipping: refunded only on total refund
  - Convenience fee: not refunded
  
  ## Mandatory Validations
  
  - Verify transaction is within deadline
  - Confirm transaction was successfully captured
  - Validate no ongoing chargeback
  - Check available balance in gateway

examples:
  - input: "Purchase $800 with 10% discount, total refund after 10 days"
    output: "Approved: refund $800 (amount paid), deadline 3-5 days (Stripe)"
  - input: "VIP customer, purchase $1,200, refund after 20 days"
    output: "Approved: within 30-day VIP deadline, mandatory manual approval"
  - input: "Partial refund $50 from $150 purchase, PayPal"
    output: "Approved: automatic < $200, processing 2-3 days"
