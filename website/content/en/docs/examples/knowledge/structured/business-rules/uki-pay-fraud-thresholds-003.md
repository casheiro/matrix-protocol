  ## Value Threshold for Manual Review
  
  **Current value:** $630
  **Justification:** Balance between friction and security based on 3-month analysis
  **Exceptions:**
  - Recurring customer (> 5 approved purchases): $900
  - VIP customer (loyalty program): $1,350
  
  ## Behavioral Rules
  
  **Multiple attempts:**
  - 3+ different cards on same IP in 1 hour: temporary block
  - 5+ failed payment attempts: flag as suspicious
  - Same card attempted on 3+ different IPs in 30min: manual review
  
  **Data validation:**
  - Obviously invalid CVV: block (000, 111, 222, etc.)
  - Same card with name variations: flag
  - Billing vs. shipping address in different countries: manual review
  
  ## Geographic Rules
  
  **Blocked IPs by country:**
  - High-risk countries defined by compliance sector
  - Exception: customer with approved history can override
  
  **Location velocity:**
  - Same account with purchases in cities > 300mi in < 2h: flag
  
  ## Escalation Matrix
  
  **Automatic (no intervention):**
  - Transaction below threshold + basic validations OK
  
  **Flagging (log + monitoring):**
  - Suspicious behavior but below critical threshold
  - Customer with positive history
  
  **Manual review (mandatory approval):**
  - Above value threshold
  - 2+ behavioral rules violated
  - First purchase from customer with suspicious data
  
  **Automatic block:**
  - 3+ critical rules violated simultaneously
  - Country on blacklist without exception
  - Obviously invalid CVV or data

examples:
  - input: "Transaction $720, new customer, Brazil IP, consistent data"
    output: "Manual review: above $630 threshold + new customer"
  - input: "Transaction $360, recurring customer, 4th purchase this month"
    output: "Automatic approval: below threshold + trusted customer"
  - input: "Transaction $144, 3 different cards, same IP, 30min"
    output: "Temporary block: suspicious multiple attempts"
