# Procedures MEF

UKIs structured documenting operational processes and organizational procedures, demonstrating how operational workflows transform from informal practices into governed, auditable procedure knowledge.

## 📊 Operational Context Overview

### Squad Payments - Operational Procedures

This section contains **5 compliant procedure UKIs** from the Example E-commerce Company, showing how critical operational workflows get structured into traceable, executable procedures with proper governance and cross-references.

### Operational Scope:
- **Domain**: Operational procedures and workflows
- **Authority**: Technical leads and operations teams
- **Maturity Range**: Draft → Validated → Approved
- **Governance**: MOC-controlled execution and compliance procedures

## 📋 Available Procedure UKIs

### 🔒 Compliance Procedures
1. **[pci-compliance-013](uki-pay-pci-compliance-013.yaml)** - PCI DSS security compliance operational procedures
2. **[incident-response-014](uki-pay-incident-response-014.yaml)** - Crisis management and resolution procedures

### 🚀 Operations Procedures
3. **[deployment-process-015](uki-pay-deployment-process-015.yaml)** - Release and deployment workflows
4. **[monitoring-alerts-016](uki-pay-monitoring-alerts-016.yaml)** - System health monitoring procedures
5. **[performance-optimization-017](uki-pay-performance-optimization-017.yaml)** - Performance tuning and optimization procedures

## 🔗 Demonstrated Relationships

### Operational Workflow Dependencies:
- **User Onboarding** `implements` Customer Validation Business Rules - Procedures execute business logic
- **PCI Compliance** `precedes` Deployment Process - Security validation before releases
- **Monitoring Operations** `complements` Incident Response - Monitoring feeds incident management
- **Deployment Process** `depends_on` Technical Patterns - Uses established architectural patterns

### Cross-Domain Integration:
- **Procedures** ↔ **Business Rules** - Operational execution of business logic
- **Procedures** ↔ **Technical Patterns** - Implementation following technical standards
- **Compliance** ↔ **Security Rules** - Operational enforcement of security policies

## ✅ MEF Compliance Demonstrated

### Required MEF v1.0.0 Fields:
- ✅ **Complete Frontmatter** - Schema version, ontology reference, versioning
- ✅ **MOC References** - All `*_ref` fields point to organizational taxonomy
- ✅ **Semantic Versioning** - MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH with operational impact tracking
- ✅ **Mandatory Examples** - Real execution scenarios and expected outcomes
- ✅ **Relationship Mapping** - Cross-references to business rules and technical patterns

### Operational Knowledge Tracking:
- ✅ **Execution Context** - When and how procedures are triggered
- ✅ **Authority Requirements** - Who can execute which procedures
- ✅ **Compliance Validation** - Audit trail for regulatory requirements
- ✅ **Change Management** - Procedure evolution with impact assessment

## 🎯 Operational Value Demonstrated

### From Informal Practices to Governed Procedures:
- **Before**: Tribal knowledge, inconsistent execution, missed compliance steps
- **After**: Documented procedures with clear steps, authority, and audit trails
- **Result**: Consistent operational excellence with regulatory compliance

### Concrete Benefits Shown:
- 🎯 **Execution Consistency** - All deployments follow same validated procedure
- 📋 **Compliance Assurance** - PCI and security requirements systematically enforced
- ⚡ **Incident Response** - Structured crisis management with clear escalation
- 🔍 **Operational Audit** - Complete execution history for post-incident analysis

## 🎯 How to Navigate

1. **Study Procedure Structure** - Notice MEF v1.0.0 compliance in operational context
2. **Follow Execution Flow** - See step-by-step operational workflows
3. **Check Authority Requirements** - Understand who can execute procedures
4. **Analyze Dependencies** - Notice relationships to business rules and technical patterns
5. **Review Examples** - Real operational scenarios and expected outcomes

### Analysis Tips:
- Each UKI shows complete procedure documentation with execution context
- Relationships reflect real operational dependencies across domains
- Authority requirements align with organizational MOC governance
- Examples provide concrete validation for procedure effectiveness

## 🎯 Operational Excellence Features

### Compliance Integration:
- **PCI Compliance** procedures ensure payment security standards
- **Incident Response** provides structured crisis management
- **Audit Trails** support regulatory compliance and post-incident analysis

### Operational Automation:
- **Deployment Process** enables consistent release management
- **Monitoring Operations** provides proactive system health management
- **User Onboarding** streamlines customer registration workflows

### Cross-Domain Coherence:
- Procedures implement business rules operationally
- Technical patterns guide procedure implementation
- Security rules enforce compliance through procedures
