# squad meeting - march

date: 03/18/2024
people present: joão, maria, ana, lucas (new dev), roberta (new qa)

## paypal gateway proved more stable

guys, after the problems we had with stripe (several outages), I think we should consider paypal as primary.

paypal advantages:
- less downtime 
- customer already knows it
- simpler integration

joão said stripe has more features, but stability is priority

## refund - customer asking for 14 days

VIP customer asked for extension to 14 days on refund. Maria approved as exception, but maybe it should be standard?? 

ana commented that 7 days is really too short, competition gives 15 days

## fraud - adjust threshold

R$ 5000 is generating too much friction, customer complaining

suggestion: raise to R$ 10000 or create different rule for returning customer

pedro wasn't present (vacation)

## other things
- stripe webhook sometimes takes 2min to arrive
- currency conversion has bug in euro rate  
- monitoring needs alert when gateway goes down
- lucas will work on API idempotency

next: 04/15
