# ZOF ‚Äî Zion Orchestration Framework
**Acronym:** ZOF  
**Version:** 0.0.1-beta  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05  

> üö® **IMPORTANT WARNING**: This document contains ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES (such as `strategy`, `operations`, etc.) that are NOT mandatory taxonomies. The **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** is the only definitive source for organizational taxonomies.

## 1. Introduction

The **Zion Orchestration Framework (ZOF)** specifies in a conceptual and standardized way the workflow framework for AI-oriented teams, defining how to describe, execute, and govern workflows as technology-independent state machines.

ZOF defines a **conceptual model for AI-oriented workflows** that allows multidisciplinary teams to describe workflows as technology-independent state machines following the pattern: **Event ‚Üí Oracle Query ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Conditional Oracle Enrichment**.

ZOF does not prescribe tools, orchestration engines, or technical implementations - it only directs **how to think and record the path** in a conceptual, traceable, and governed way.

---

## 2. Terms and Definitions

- **Canonical States**: Universal sequence of states in workflows (Intake ‚Üí Understand ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Act ‚Üí EvaluateForEnrich ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Enrich)
- **EvaluateForEnrich**: Mandatory checkpoint for enrichment evaluation
- **Canonical Events**: Standard workflow triggers (knowledge.added, work.proposed, etc.)
- **Explainability Signals**: Context, decision, and result recorded at each state
- **can_enrich?()**: Cognitive filter function for enrichment decision
- **Scope Mode**: Propagation behavior of knowledge (restricted vs propagated)

Cross-reference to **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** for organization-specific taxonomies.

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### ZOF Essence in 3 Concepts

**1. Flow Thought as State**
- All work is a journey: Receive ‚Üí Understand ‚Üí Decide ‚Üí Do ‚Üí Evaluate ‚Üí (Possibly) Teach
- Each transition is conscious: I know why I changed state
- Explainability is natural: I record context, decision and result

**2. Oracle as Intelligent Advisor**
- Before deciding anything, I consult the Oracle: "What do we already know about this?"
- Oracle returns only knowledge I have authority to see (via MOC)
- At the end, I can teach the Oracle if I learned something truly new

**3. Governance via MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)**
- MOC defines who can create knowledge in which scope/domain
- MOC establishes organizational criteria to validate if it's worth teaching the Oracle
- Different organizations configure different rules - there are no global impositions

### The Universal Pattern
```

EVENT ‚Üí QUERY ORACLE ‚Üí DECISION ‚Üí ACTION ‚Üí EVALUATE IF WORTH TEACHING ‚Üí (TEACH)
```


### Mandatory Canonical States
Every ZOF flow follows this conceptual sequence:
1. **Intake**: Context and requirements capture
2. **Understand**: Mandatory Oracle consultation (UKIs)
3. **Decide**: Decision based on existing knowledge
4. **Act**: Execution of planned action
5. **EvaluateForEnrich**: Mandatory evaluation checkpoint
6. **Review**: Optional result validation
7. **Enrich**: Conditional Oracle enrichment

---

## 4. Normative Rules

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section is **normative**.

### Mandatory Canonical States
All ZOF workflows MUST follow the canonical states sequence without exception.

### Mandatory EvaluateForEnrich Checkpoint
- MUST be applied to all workflows
- MUST consult criteria defined in organizational MOC
- MUST generate epistemological justification for decisions
- MUST respect MOC authorities and scopes
- MUST detect conflict types H1/H2/H3 and invoke MAL if local resolution fails
- MUST apply MAL decisions when arbitration is required
- MUST apply scope_mode validation for multi-scope enrichment scenarios

### Mandatory Explainability Signals
Each state transition MUST record:
- **context**: What entered the state
- **decision**: Why it transitioned
- **result**: What exited the state

### Mandatory Oracle Consultation
The **Understand** state MUST always consult the Oracle (UKIs) before any decision.

### can_enrich?() Function Requirements
- MUST implement semantic novelty evaluation
- MUST implement practical value assessment
- MUST implement authority validation via MOC
- MAY implement additional organizational criteria

### State Transition Rules
- State transitions MUST be sequential and cannot skip states
- Each state MUST complete before transitioning to next state
- Understand state MUST receive Oracle consultation results before proceeding
- EvaluateForEnrich MUST complete evaluation before allowing Enrich state
- Failed evaluations MAY terminate flow or require remediation
- MAL arbitration MUST be invoked on conflict detection during EvaluateForEnrich
- MAL Decision Records MUST be applied through appropriate actions (gate_enrich, deprecate, partition_scope, etc.)

### Scope Mode Implementation
- **Restricted mode**: Knowledge remains within originating scope level
- **Propagated mode**: Knowledge can cascade to higher scope levels via promotion
- Scope mode MUST be declared during UKI creation
- Promotion between scopes MUST follow MOC governance rules

### üåê Multi-scope Enrichment with Domain Validation (Normative)

ZOF MUST implement specific rules for enrichment operations that cross multiple scope or domain boundaries.

#### Cross-boundary Enrichment Detection
```yaml

# --- Normative Configuration ---
cross_boundary_detection:
  scope_crossing:
    source_scope: "team"              # UKI originates from team scope
    enrichment_target_scope: "tribe"   # Enrichment targets tribe scope
    classification: "scope_crossing"
    
  domain_crossing:
    source_domain: "technical"         # UKI originates from technical domain
    enrichment_target_domain: "business" # Enrichment targets business domain
    classification: "domain_crossing"
    
  multi_boundary_crossing:
    source: {scope: "team", domain: "technical"}
    target: {scope: "tribe", domain: "business"}
    classification: "multi_boundary_crossing"
```


#### Authority Validation for Cross-boundary Enrichment
- **Hierarchical Authority Check**: User MUST have authority in BOTH source and target hierarchies
- **Cross-domain Validation**: For domain crossing, user MUST have domain_access to both domains in MOC
- **Escalation Path**: If user lacks cross-boundary authority, MUST route to escalation path via MOC
- **Joint Approval**: Multi-boundary crossing MAY require approval from authorities in multiple hierarchies

#### Cross-boundary Enrichment Rules
```yaml

# --- Normative Rules ---
cross_boundary_enrichment_rules:
  scope_crossing_rules:
    upward_promotion:                    # team ‚Üí tribe, tribe ‚Üí org
      authority_requirement: "source_scope_authority + promotion_rights"
      approval_process: "hierarchical_escalation"
      rationale_requirement: "mandatory_promotion_rationale"
    
    lateral_crossing:                    # team-a ‚Üí team-b
      authority_requirement: "both_scope_authority OR superior_authority"
      approval_process: "peer_approval OR escalation"
      conflict_resolution: "invoke_MAL_if_contested"
  
  domain_crossing_rules:
    technical_to_business:
      authority_requirement: "multi_domain_access"
      validation_criteria: "business_value_assessment + technical_accuracy"
      review_process: "cross_domain_review_committee"
    
    cross_domain_conflict_resolution:
      detection: "semantic_conflicts_across_domains"
      resolution: "invoke_MAL_with_cross_domain_context"
      outcome_application: "domain_specific_actions"
```


#### EvaluateForEnrich for Cross-boundary Operations
- **Extended Criteria**: Cross-boundary enrichment MUST apply additional evaluation criteria from MOC
- **Impact Analysis**: MUST assess impact on both source and target hierarchies
- **Conflict Detection**: MUST detect potential semantic conflicts across boundaries
- **Authority Validation**: MUST validate authority for all affected hierarchical levels
- **Scope Validation Mode**: MUST apply scope_mode configuration for multi-scope scenarios
- **MAL Invocation**: MUST invoke MAL for cross-boundary conflicts that cannot be resolved locally

#### üéØ Scope Mode Configuration (Normative)

ZOF MUST implement scope_mode validation for enrichment operations that affect multiple scopes.

##### Scope Mode Types
```yaml

# --- Normative Configuration ---
scope_mode_validation:
  validation_types:
    any:                               # Satisfy one scope is sufficient
      description: "Enrichment approved if ANY affected scope validates successfully"
      use_case: "Broad knowledge sharing, cross-team collaboration"
      authority_requirement: "minimum_scope_authority"
      validation_logic: "OR operation across all affected scopes"
      
    all:                               # All scopes must validate
      description: "Enrichment approved only if ALL affected scopes validate successfully"
      use_case: "Strict governance, compliance-critical knowledge"
      authority_requirement: "maximum_scope_authority"
      validation_logic: "AND operation across all affected scopes"

  configuration_source: "MOC organizational policy"
  default_behavior: "all"              # Conservative default for safety
  
  scope_mode_determination:
    explicit_configuration:            # Organization sets scope_mode in MOC
      source: "MOC evaluation_criteria configuration"
      precedence: "highest"
      
    knowledge_type_based:              # Based on UKI type (policy vs guideline)
      policy_knowledge: "all"          # Policies require all scope validation
      guideline_knowledge: "any"       # Guidelines can use any scope validation
      precedence: "medium"
      
    fallback_default: "all"            # Conservative fallback
    precedence: "lowest"
```


##### Scope Mode Application Examples
```yaml

# --- Illustrative Examples ---
scope_mode_scenarios:
  scenario_1_cross_team_guideline:
    context: "Development guideline from team-a enriching team-b scope"
    affected_scopes: ["team-a", "team-b"]
    knowledge_type: "guideline"
    scope_mode: "any"                  # Either team validation sufficient
    validation_result: "APPROVED if team-a OR team-b validates"
    
  scenario_2_organizational_policy:
    context: "Security policy affecting multiple organizational levels"
    affected_scopes: ["squad", "tribe", "organization"]
    knowledge_type: "policy"
    scope_mode: "all"                  # All levels must validate
    validation_result: "APPROVED only if squad AND tribe AND organization validate"
    
  scenario_3_domain_crossing:
    context: "Technical knowledge enriching business domain"
    affected_scopes: ["technical", "business"]
    knowledge_type: "pattern"
    scope_mode: "any"                  # Cross-domain sharing encouraged
    validation_result: "APPROVED if technical OR business validates"
```


##### Integration with MOC Authority
- **Authority Mapping**: scope_mode MUST respect MOC authority hierarchies for each affected scope
- **Escalation Paths**: Failed validation in "all" mode MUST provide escalation paths from MOC
- **Audit Trail**: All scope validation decisions MUST be recorded with scope_mode rationale

---

## 5. Interoperability

ZOF orchestrates workflows that span all Matrix Protocol frameworks through canonical states:

- **MEF (Matrix Embedding Framework)**: Consumes UKIs during Understand state Oracle consultation; produces structured UKIs during Enrich state; maintains semantic relationships between motivating and created knowledge; persists MAL Decision Records
- **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)**: Provides evaluation criteria for EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint; validates user authority for enrichment operations; defines organizational taxonomies for workflow context; configures MAL arbitration policies
- **OIF (Operator Intelligence Framework)**: Workflow Agents execute canonical states; Knowledge Agents handle Oracle consultation; intelligence archetypes provide governance-aware workflow orchestration; explains MAL arbitration outcomes to users
- **MEP (Matrix Epistemic Principle)**: Guides epistemological justification in EvaluateForEnrich; ensures derived authority principles in enrichment decisions; mandates explainability through signal recording; provides foundation for MAL epistemic rationale
- **MAL (Matrix Arbiter Layer)**: Invoked by ZOF when EvaluateForEnrich detects unresolvable conflicts (H1/H2/H3); provides deterministic arbitration decisions; returns actions for ZOF execution (gate_enrich, deprecate, partition_scope)

See Matrix Protocol Integration Diagram for detailed workflow integration patterns.

## 6. Conventions and Examples

All examples in this document are **illustrative only** and do not define normative behavior.  
Normative semantics (scopes, governance, archetypes, enrich criteria) are always derived from the **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** of each organization.  
Examples are provided for clarity and MAY be adapted to local contexts, but MUST NOT be treated as protocol-level obligations.
