## About Matrix Protocol

Matrix Protocol is a comprehensive framework for human-AI collaboration through organized knowledge structures and orchestrated workflows. This resource repository provides all templates, guides, and tools necessary to implement the protocol in your organization.

## üéØ Main Components

### MEF - Matrix Embedding Framework
Framework for knowledge structuring through Units of Knowledge Interlinked (UKIs).

### ZOF - Zion Orchestration Framework
Conceptual workflow framework for AI-oriented teams with mandatory checkpoints.

### OIF - Operator Intelligence Framework
Practical execution framework with hierarchical AI archetypes.

### MOC - Matrix Ontology Catalog
Ontological catalog that enables separation between universal concepts and organizational taxonomies.

### MAL - Matrix Arbiter Layer
Deterministic arbitration layer for conflict resolution with 6 precedence rules.

## üìã Available Resources

### MOC Templates by Organizational Size
- **Startup** (5-50 employees): Simplified and agile structure
- **Scale-up** (50-200 employees): Tribes & Squads
- **Enterprise** (200-1000 employees): Formal governance
- **Corporation** (1000+ employees): Multi-regional and regulated

### Implementation Guides
- Complete implementation guide (12 weeks)
- Validation checklists
- Practical UKI examples
- Organizational use cases

### UKI Templates
- Business Rules
- Technical Patterns
- Organizational Procedures
- Complex structures with relationships

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Assess your organizational size** and download the appropriate MOC template
2. **Customize hierarchies** according to your structure
3. **Implement pilot UKIs** using provided templates
4. **Configure ZOF workflows** with mandatory checkpoints
5. **Test integration** with existing tools

## üìê Template Structure

### MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)
```yaml

moc_version: "1.0"
organization: "Your Organization"
hierarchies:
  scope:     # Reach and visibility
  domain:    # Knowledge domains
  type:      # UKI types
  maturity:  # Maturity levels
```

### UKI (Units of Knowledge Interlinked)
```yaml

schema: "1.0"
id: uki:[scope_ref]:[type_ref]:[slug-id]
title: "Descriptive Title"
content: |
  Structured knowledge content
relationships:
  - type: depends_on
    target: uki:other:example:001
```

## üîß Technical Implementation
