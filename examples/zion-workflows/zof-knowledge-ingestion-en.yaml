        title: "New External API Validation Rule"
        content: |
          Critical rule for updated validation according to new external API version.
          
          BREAKING CHANGE: External API changed request validation method.
          
          Mandatory implementation:
          1. Update validation endpoint to use new method
          2. Configure new key in configuration panel
          3. Maintain compatibility during transition period
          4. Test with provided development tools
          
          Updated validation process:
          - New signature method must be implemented
          - Integrity validation using updated algorithm
          - Error handling according to new specification
          
          DEADLINE: Implement according to established transition timeline
        examples:
          - input: "Request received with new validation"
            output: "Successful validation with updated method"
          - input: "Request with previous validation"
            output: "Fallback to previous method during transition period"

        title: "Migration Pattern for External API Changes"
        content: |
          Pattern for migrating integrations when external API introduces significant changes.
          
          CONTEXT: Specific field will be discontinued in external API
          REPLACEMENT: New field with equivalent functionality
          
          Migration strategy:
          1. Map all current uses of old field
          2. Implement dual logic (read both, write new)
          3. Migrate existing data via structured process
          4. Remove old references after confirmation
          
          Dual pattern implementation:
          - Compatible reading during transition
          - Writing always using new format
          - Data validation in both formats
          - Logs for transition monitoring
          
          Migration checklist:
          - [ ] Identify old field uses in code
          - [ ] Implement dual reading logic
          - [ ] Update creation to use new field
          - [ ] Existing data migration process
          - [ ] Regression tests
          - [ ] Remove legacy code after transition
        examples:
          - input: "Record created with old field"
            output: "Automatic migration to new field"
          - input: "Reading existing record"
            output: "Fallback to old field if new field doesn't exist"

        title: "Strategy for New External API Rate Limits"
        content: |
          Guidelines for dealing with external API rate limit changes.
          
          CHANGES:
          - Main endpoints: reduced limit
          - Secondary endpoints: no change
          - New headers available for monitoring
          
          Implementation strategies:
          1. Implement retry with exponential backoff
          2. Use headers for proactive control
          3. Aggressive caching for data that changes little
          4. Batch operations when possible
          
          Conceptual implementation:
          - Intelligent retry system
          - Proactive limit monitoring
          - Strategic caching based on usage patterns
          - Batch request optimization
          
          Recommended monitoring:
          - Alerts for limit close to maximum
          - Retry rate metrics
          - Performance dashboard per endpoint
        examples:
          - input: "Rate limit error on main endpoint"
            output: "Automatic retry with exponential backoff"
          - input: "Header indicating limit proximity"
            output: "Preventively pause requests"

        content: |
          Practical example of implementation using updated external API functionalities.
          
          NEW: Updated API offers greater control and improved functionalities.
          
          Recommended flow:
          1. Create request using new structure
          2. Confirm in frontend with new resources

          Conceptual implementation:
          - Updated request structure
          - Improved frontend processing
          - Webhook handling with new structure
          - Improved error handling
          
          Advantages vs previous version:
          - Better user experience
          - Native support for new functionalities
          - More granular flow control
          - Automatic retry for temporary failures
        examples:
          - input: "Operation using new structure"
