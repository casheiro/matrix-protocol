          Authentication pattern implementation following Oracle guidelines.
          
          Conceptual components:
          - Token service: generation and validation
          - Authentication middleware: request interception
          - Authentication endpoints: login and refresh
          
          Applied security guidelines:
          - Tokens with expiration according to business policy
          - Refresh tokens with controlled lifecycle
          - Algorithms following established security standards
          - Configurations aligned with organizational requirements
          
          Pattern application:
          - Implementation of Oracle-defined architecture
          - Validation against existing security guidelines
          - Standardized authentication process
        examples:
          - input: "User logs in with valid credentials"
            output: "Returns access token + refresh token"
          - input: "Request with expired token"
            output: "Appropriate response with refresh guidance"
          - input: "Refresh request with valid token"
            output: "New access token generated maintaining refresh token"

          Pattern for implementing token refresh using secure storage.
          
          Characteristics:
          - Refresh tokens stored securely
          - Structured keys for unique identification
          - Automatic TTL for expiration
          - Support for manual revocation
          
          Conceptual implementation:
          1. On login, generate unique refresh token
          2. Store securely with appropriate TTL
          3. On refresh, validate existence and renew access token
          4. Rotate refresh token periodically
          
          Benefits:
          - Superior performance to conventional storage
          - Automatic TTL avoids manual cleanup
          - Horizontal scalability
        examples:
          - input: "User login"
            output: "Secure storage of refresh token with TTL"
          - input: "Refresh request"
            output: "Validation and new access token generation"
          - input: "Logout"
            output: "Refresh token invalidated"
