          Optimized onboarding process following Oracle guidelines.
          
          Applied design principles:
          1. Simplified entry based on essentials
          2. Progressive information collection during usage
          3. Visual progress indicators
          4. Options to skip non-essential steps
          5. Reduced time to first value
          
          Optimized flow:
          1. Simplified entry (essential fields)
          2. Automated verification in background
          3. Welcome + direct access to main value
          4. Contextual tutorial (only when necessary)
          5. Additional information collection as needed
          
          Success guidelines:
          - Process optimized based on conversion guidelines
          - Reduced time to first action
          - Improved conversion to active user
        examples:
          - input: "User accesses entry process"
            output: "Optimized form with essential fields + benefit guidance"
          - input: "Entry completed"
            output: "Direct redirect to first value (main dashboard)"
          - input: "First week of use"
            output: "Progressive collection: additional info via micro-interactions"

        title: "Incremental Refinement Pattern with Validation"
        content: |
          Methodology for product flow refinement using validated incremental approach.
          
          Conceptual process:
          1. Identify friction points via data and feedback
          2. Prioritize improvements by knowledge-based impact
          3. Divide changes into small, validatable waves
          4. Implement one wave at a time with validation
          5. Validate results before next wave
          6. Document learnings in Oracle
          
          Wave structure:
          - Wave 1: Highest impact / lowest risk change
          - Wave 2: Experience improvements
          - Wave 3: Engagement/gamification elements
          
          Success criteria:
          - Each wave should significantly improve main indicator
          - Validation based on established knowledge
          - No degradation of secondary indicators
          - Rollback capability if indicators worsen
          
          Benefits:
          - Controlled risk
          - Continuous learning
          - Granular rollback possibility
          - Measurable return per change
        examples:
          - input: "Process with identified improvement opportunity"
            output: "Wave 1: simplification → verified improvement"
          - input: "Positive result after wave 1"
            output: "Wave 2: experience improvement → new validation"
          - input: "Indicator worsens in validation"
            output: "Automatic rollback to previous version"
