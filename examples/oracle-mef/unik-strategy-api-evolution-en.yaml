  Organizational strategy for REST API evolution and versioning, ensuring compatibility and continuous innovation.
  
  This strategic decision defines how the organization will approach API changes over time.
  
  ## Decision Context
  
  With the growth of microservices architecture, we need a clear strategy for API evolution that:
  - Maintains compatibility with existing clients
  - Enables continuous innovation and improvements
  - Reduces maintenance costs
  - Facilitates adoption of new features
  
  ## Adopted Strategy: Semantic Versioning with Sunset
  
  ### Main Approach
  
  1. **URL Versioning**: `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`
  2. **Compatibility**: Maintain 2 major versions simultaneously
  3. **Sunset Period**: 18 months for complete deprecation
  4. **Minor Changes**: Always backward compatible
  
  ### Evolution Timeline

  ```
  
  ## Criteria for New Major Version
  
  - Breaking changes to existing contracts
  - Significant data restructuring
  - Removal of deprecated features
  - Changes to authentication protocols
  
  ## Migration Process
  
  1. **Announcement**: 6 months before release
  2. **Beta**: Beta version available 3 months prior
  3. **Release**: Stable version in production
  4. **Dual Support**: 18 months of parallel versions
  5. **Sunset**: Gradual deactivation of old version
  
  ## Expected Benefits
  
  - 40% reduction in client migration time
  - Greater predictability for development teams
  - Decreased compatibility-related bugs
  - Easier adoption of new technologies
examples:
  - input: "Team wants to add new required field to API"
    output: "Implement in new minor version as optional, make required in next major"
  - input: "Client requests to maintain API v1 for 6 more months"
    output: "Evaluate impact vs benefit, consider extended support contract"
  - input: "Critical security vulnerability discovered"
    output: "Immediate patch across all active versions, urgent client communication"
