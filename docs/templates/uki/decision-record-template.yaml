# --- Examples (Mandatory) ---
examples:
  - input: "Team needs to choose between React and Vue for new frontend project"
    output: "Decision documented with context (team skills, project requirements), alternatives evaluated (React vs Vue vs Angular), criteria applied (learning curve, ecosystem, performance), and React selected with implementation plan and success metrics defined."
  - input: "Database performance issues require architectural decision"
    output: "Problem context documented (current performance metrics), alternatives analyzed (scaling up, sharding, new database), decision made with clear rationale, implementation timeline with milestones, and review schedule established."

# =============================================================================
# USAGE GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

# This template is optimized for:
# - Architecture decisions (technology choices, design patterns)
# - Process decisions (workflow changes, tool adoption)
# - Business decisions (feature priorities, resource allocation)
# - Policy decisions (governance, compliance, standards)

# Key principles:
# 1. Be specific and actionable in the decision statement
# 2. Clearly document alternatives that were considered
# 3. Provide measurable success criteria
# 4. Include implementation timeline and ownership
# 5. Plan for decision review and validation
# 6. Consider both short-term and long-term impacts
