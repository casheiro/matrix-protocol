# MAL — Matrix Arbiter Layer
**Acronym:** MAL  
**Version:** 0.0.1-beta
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-05  

> "In the absence of conflict, wisdom remains untested." — Ancient Proverb

---

## 1. Introduction

The **Matrix Arbiter Layer (MAL)** is the protocol's conflict and concurrency arbitration layer that operates as the final decision-making authority when local governance rules cannot resolve complex conflicts.

MAL is invoked **only** when local rules (scope filtering, authority validation, EvaluateForEnrich) cannot resolve three specific conflict types: horizontal conflicts between equivalent UKIs, concurrent enrichment attempts, and promotion contentions.

MAL does not replace MOC, ZOF, OIF, or MEF; it provides deterministic decision-making, then delegates explanation to OIF and persistence to MEF while respecting MOC-configured policies.

---

## 2. Terms and Definitions

- **Arbitration Event**: A normalized input describing a conflict or concurrency condition requiring MAL decision
- **Decision Record**: A signed, immutable outcome with winner/loser designation, rationale, and references
- **Precedence Policy**: Ordered tie-break rules configured in MOC with MAL-provided defaults
- **Horizontal Conflict (H1)**: Two or more UKIs of equivalent scope level that conflict semantically
- **Concurrent Enrichment (H2)**: Two or more flows attempting to enrich overlapping semantics simultaneously
- **Promotion Contention (H3)**: Competing proposals to promote distinct UKIs to higher governance level

Cross-reference to **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** for organization-specific arbitration policies.

---

## 3. Core Concepts

### No-Op Principle
MAL operates as a last resort arbitration layer. If scope/authority rules can resolve conflicts locally through standard MOC validation, MAL MUST NOT be invoked.

### Deterministic Decision-Making
Given identical inputs and policy configuration, MAL MUST produce consistent, reproducible decisions across all invocations to ensure system predictability.

### Epistemic Rationale Integration
Every MAL decision MUST include epistemological justification aligned with MEP principles, referencing specific MOC nodes and providing traceable reasoning.

### Auditability and Transparency
All arbitration decisions MUST be persisted as immutable Decision Records with complete traceability to input UKIs, MOC policies, and reasoning chains.

### Non-blocking User Experience
If MAL cannot decide within the configured arbitration_timeout, ZOF MUST apply the safe default outcome:
- Outcome = no enrich
- Status = pending arbitration

OIF MUST notify the user that arbitration is pending, including escalation instructions from the MOC if available.

---

## 4. Normative Rules

> ⚠️ This section is **normative**.

### Mandatory Invocation Conditions
ZOF MUST invoke MAL when it detects conflict types H1, H2, or H3 after EvaluateForEnrich checkpoint completion and local resolution attempts have failed.

### Arbitration Authority Boundaries
- MAL MUST make final decisions on conflicts within its scope
- MAL MUST NOT communicate outcomes directly to users
- OIF MUST NOT attempt arbitration; it MUST only explain MAL outcomes
- OIF MUST render all MAL outcomes using an Arbitration Explanation Template that includes at least:
  - decision_id
  - outcome
  - winner/losers (if applicable)
  - precedence_applied
  - epistemic_rationale with moc_nodes cited
- MEF MUST persist all MAL decisions as immutable Decision Records
- MOC MUST provide policy configuration but MUST NOT override MAL decisions

### Normalized Input Requirements
Every Arbitration Event MUST contain:
- **event_id**: Unique identifier for the arbitration request
- **event_type**: One of {H1, H2, H3} indicating conflict classification
- **candidates[]**: Array of conflicting UKI references with complete metadata
- **user_moc_context**: User's hierarchical claims and authority levels
- **operation**: Requested operation type (read/enrich/promote)
- **policy_ref**: Optional reference to specific MOC arbitration policy

### Precedence Policy Hierarchy

MAL MUST apply precedence rules as configured in the MOC.

If policy_ref is provided in the Arbitration Event, MAL MUST resolve using the referenced policy from the MOC.

If absent, MAL MAY fallback to its canonical default precedence (P1–P6).

Organizations SHOULD always configure arbitration policies in the MOC to override defaults.

Canonical default precedence order:
1. **P1 Authority Weight**: Higher authority node in MOC hierarchy wins
2. **P2 Scope Specificity**: More specific scope wins for local instructions; broader scope wins for mandatory global rules
3. **P3 Maturity Level**: validated > endorsed > draft/experimental
4. **P4 Temporal Recency**: More recent version wins if not violating lifecycle rules
5. **P5 Evidence Density**: UKI with more MEF evidence links and references
6. **P6 Deterministic Fallback**: Lexicographic UKI identifier comparison

### Decision Outcomes
MAL MUST produce one of four outcomes:
- **winner**: Single UKI chosen as authoritative
- **coexist**: Multiple UKIs valid through scope partitioning
- **reject_all**: None satisfies policy requirements
- **defer**: Requires human override or escalation

### Persistence and Communication Requirements

MAL MUST NOT introduce ontological terms outside of the MOC.

All outcomes must reference existing ontology fields:
- scope_ref (partitioning)
- authority_ref (authority hierarchy)  
- lifecycle_ref (promotion/deprecation rules)

Relationships (conflicts_with, supersedes) MUST be persisted in the MEF, always citing MOC references.

- MEF MUST store Decision Records with conflict relationships using MOC ontological terms
- OIF MUST receive structured messages to explain decisions using Arbitration Explanation Templates
- Arbitration Explanation Templates MUST include minimum required fields: decision_id, outcome, winner/losers, precedence_applied, epistemic_rationale with moc_nodes cited
- All decisions MUST include epistemic rationale referencing MOC nodes and MEF evidence

### Time Constraints and Consistency
- MAL MUST complete arbitration within arbitration_timeout configured in MOC
- If MAL cannot decide within the configured arbitration_timeout, ZOF MUST apply the safe default outcome:
  - Outcome = no enrich
  - Status = pending arbitration
- OIF MUST notify the user that arbitration is pending, including escalation instructions from the MOC if available
- Decision Records MUST be immutable once persisted

---

## 5. Interoperability

MAL operates as the arbitration nexus integrating decision-making across all Matrix Protocol frameworks:

- **MEF (Matrix Embedding Framework)**: Persists Decision Records as immutable audit trail; maintains conflict relationship metadata; provides evidence density calculations for precedence evaluation
- **ZOF (Zion Orchestration Framework)**: Detects H1/H2/H3 conditions during EvaluateForEnrich; invokes MAL with normalized Arbitration Events; applies MAL decisions through workflow actions
- **OIF (Operator Intelligence Framework)**: Renders MAL decisions to users via Arbitration Explanation templates; maintains epistemic humility by not overriding MAL determinations; provides contextual explanations
- **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)**: Provides arbitration policies and precedence rule configuration; supplies authority hierarchy for P1 evaluation; defines scope specificity rules for P2 evaluation
- **MEP (Matrix Epistemic Principle)**: Guides epistemic rationale generation; ensures derived authority principles in decision explanations; mandates explainability in arbitration outcomes

See [Matrix Protocol Integration Diagram](MATRIX_PROTOCOL_INTEGRATION_DIAGRAM.md) for MAL arbitration workflow patterns.

## 6. Conventions and Examples

All examples in this document are **illustrative only** and do not define normative behavior.  
Normative semantics (scopes, governance, archetypes, enrich criteria) are always derived from the **MOC (Matrix Ontology Catalog)** of each organization.  
Examples are provided for clarity and MAY be adapted to local contexts, but MUST NOT be treated as protocol-level obligations.

    reasoning: |
      Frontend SPA and backend API authentication patterns address
      different technical contexts with complementary approaches.
      Coexistence preserves domain-specific expertise while ensuring
      security principle consistency.
