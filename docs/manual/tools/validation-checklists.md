## 📋 Phase 1: MOC Foundation - Validation Checklist

### **Week 1-2: Assessment and Discovery**

#### **Stakeholder Interview Checklist**
- [ ] **Interview Coverage (Target: 80%+ of key roles)**
  - [ ] C-Level executives (at least 2)
  - [ ] Middle management (managers, tech leads, product owners)
  - [ ] Senior individual contributors (domain experts)
  - [ ] Support functions (HR, Legal, IT, Compliance if applicable)
  
- [ ] **Interview Quality Validation**
  - [ ] Each interview lasted 45-60 minutes
  - [ ] Specific pain points identified (not generic complaints)
  - [ ] Real examples provided for each pain point
  - [ ] Decision flow examples mapped for each role
  - [ ] Systems and tools currently used documented

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Generic answers like "communication could be better"
- ❌ No specific examples of knowledge problems
- ❌ Stakeholder says "we don't have knowledge problems"
- ❌ Can't identify who makes what decisions

#### **Systems Inventory Checklist**
- [ ] **Complete System Discovery**
  - [ ] All knowledge systems identified (wikis, docs, repos, chat)
  - [ ] Usage patterns documented (who uses what, when)
  - [ ] Integration points mapped
  - [ ] Access control mechanisms understood
  
- [ ] **Quality Assessment Completed**
  - [ ] Content duplication rate quantified
  - [ ] Outdated content percentage measured
  - [ ] Conflicting information instances documented
  - [ ] Search/findability issues cataloged

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Found 15+ separate knowledge systems (typical range)
- ✅ Identified 40%+ content duplication (common baseline)
- ✅ Documented 60%+ outdated content (if this low, question methodology)
- ✅ Found specific conflicting information (proves need)

#### **Decision Flow Mapping Checklist**
- [ ] **Decision Categories Identified**
  - [ ] Technical decisions (architecture, tools, standards)
  - [ ] Product decisions (features, priorities, requirements)
  - [ ] Operational decisions (processes, policies, resource allocation)
  - [ ] Strategic decisions (direction, investments, partnerships)
  
- [ ] **Authority Mapping Completed**
  - [ ] Formal authority documented (org chart)
  - [ ] Actual authority identified (who really decides)
  - [ ] Gaps between formal and actual documented
  - [ ] Escalation paths for each decision type mapped

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ Real vs formal authority differs in 50%+ of decisions (typical finding)
- ✅ Clear escalation paths exist for each decision category
- ✅ Conflict resolution mechanisms identified
- ✅ Decision bottlenecks and delays documented

### **Week 3-4: MOC Design**

- [ ] **Authority Hierarchy**
  - [ ] Matches real decision-making patterns
  - [ ] Clear escalation paths
  - [ ] Appropriate granularity (not too many levels)
