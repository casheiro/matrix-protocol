  ## TechCorp Design System Component Standards
  
  ### Core Principles
  1. **Consistency:** All user-facing components must use design system tokens
  2. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all components
  3. **Performance:** Component bundle size < 50KB gzipped
  4. **Documentation:** Every component requires usage examples and API docs
  
  ### Component Categories
  
  #### Atomic Components
  - Button variations (primary, secondary, destructive, ghost)
  - Input fields (text, email, password, search, textarea)
  - Icons (using TechCorp icon library v3.2+)
  - Typography elements (headings, body text, captions)
  
  #### Molecular Components  
  - Form groups (input + label + error message)
  - Card layouts (content cards, action cards, info cards)
  - Navigation elements (breadcrumbs, pagination, tabs)
  - Data display (tables, lists, key-value pairs)
  
  #### Organism Components
  - Header/navigation patterns
  - Footer patterns  
  - Form layouts (login, registration, checkout)
  - Dashboard layouts
  
  ### Implementation Requirements
  
  #### React Components
  ```typescript
  // All components must follow this interface pattern
  interface ComponentProps {
    className?: string;
    testId?: string;
    children?: React.ReactNode;
    // ... component-specific props
  }
  
  // Example implementation
  export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
    variant = 'primary',
    size = 'medium',
    disabled = false,
    children,
    testId = 'button',
    ...props
  }) => {
    return (
      <button 
        className={cn('tc-button', variant, size)}
        disabled={disabled}
        data-testid={testId}
        {...props}
      >
        {children}
      </button>
    );
  };
  ```
  
  #### Vue Components
  ```vue
  <!-- All Vue components must include proper TypeScript typing -->
  <template>
    <button 
      :class="buttonClasses" 
      :disabled="disabled"
      :data-testid="testId"
      @click="$emit('click', $event)"
    >
      <slot />
    </button>
  </template>
  
  <script setup lang="ts">
  interface Props {
    variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'destructive' | 'ghost';
    size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    disabled?: boolean;
    testId?: string;
  }
  
  const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
    variant: 'primary',
    size: 'medium', 
    disabled: false,
    testId: 'button'
  });
  </script>
  ```
  
  ### Testing Requirements
  - Unit tests: 90%+ coverage for all components
  - Visual regression tests: Chromatic snapshots for all variations
  - Accessibility tests: axe-core automated testing
  - Performance tests: Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
  
  ### Documentation Standards
  - Storybook stories for all component variations
  - Usage guidelines with do/don't examples
  - API documentation with TypeScript interfaces
  - Migration guides for breaking changes

examples:
  - input: "Frontend team needs to implement a new user registration form"
    output: "Team uses Button (primary), Input (text, email, password), Form Group molecular components following accessibility standards. Form validation uses design system error patterns."
    
  - input: "Mobile app team building product listing page"
    output: "Team uses Card (content variant) organism, Typography (heading, body) atomic components, and Pagination molecular component. Mobile-specific spacing tokens applied."
    
  - input: "Design system component needs breaking API change"
    output: "Follow semantic versioning with MAJOR bump. Create migration guide. Provide 90-day deprecation notice. Update all consuming teams via Slack automation."

**Real-World OIF Interaction Examples**

**Example 1: Knowledge Agent Query**
```yaml
user_query: "What's our standard approach for implementing user authentication in new microservices?"

knowledge_agent_response:
  authority_context: "Based on your Principal Engineer role with Engineering Division access"
  moc_filtering: "Showing UKIs accessible within your authority scope"
  
  response: |
    According to TechCorp's authentication standards, new microservices should implement:
    
    **Primary Standard (Organization-wide):**
    - OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for external APIs (per uki:organization:policy:api-security-standards-001)
    - mTLS certificates for internal service-to-service communication
    - JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration
    
    **Implementation Pattern (Engineering Division):**
    - Use TechCorp Auth Library v2.3+ (per uki:engineering-division:pattern:auth-library-integration-002)
    - Follow microservice security template (per uki:core-systems-tribe:template:microservice-scaffold-003)
    - Integrate with centralized audit logging (per uki:organization:procedure:security-audit-logging-001)
    
    **Your Authority Level:** As Principal Engineer, you can approve squad-level and tribe-level auth implementations. Organization-wide changes require Architecture Committee approval.
    
  moc_nodes_cited:
    - "moc:authority:principal_engineer" 
    - "moc:domain:security"
    - "moc:scope:engineering-division"
    - "moc:type:policy"
    
  derived_authority_principle: |
    This recommendation derives from TechCorp's organizational security policies and 
    engineering standards. For microservices with special requirements (e.g., payment 
    processing), consult Security Team for additional compliance requirements.

    - "Troubleshooting: uki:platform-engineering-tribe:guideline:auth-debugging-006"
```

**Example 2: Architecture Consultant Decision Support**
```yaml
user_query: "We're considering GraphQL vs REST for our new customer data API. What does our organization recommend?"

architecture_consultant_response:
  authority_context: "Based on your Squad Lead role with Customer Experience Tribe scope"
  decision_support_mode: "Comparative analysis with organizational precedents"
  
  response: |
    **TechCorp API Strategy Analysis:**
    
    **Organizational Precedent:**
    - Current standard: REST APIs (per uki:organization:standard:api-design-principles-001)
    - GraphQL evaluation completed: (per uki:organization:decision:graphql-adoption-evaluation-002)
    - Result: "Approved for specific use cases, not default choice"
    
    **Your Use Case: Customer Data API**
    
    **REST Recommendation (Primary):**
    ‚úÖ Aligns with organizational standard
    ‚úÖ Team expertise exists (all developers familiar)
    ‚úÖ Existing monitoring/security infrastructure
    ‚úÖ Simpler caching strategy
    
    **GraphQL Consideration:**
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Architecture Committee approval for new adoption
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional security controls needed (query complexity limits)
    ‚ö†Ô∏è Team training required (estimated 2-3 weeks)
    ‚úÖ Better fit for complex nested customer data queries
    ‚úÖ Reduces over-fetching for mobile clients
    
    **Recommendation:** 
    Start with REST implementation following TechCorp standards. If complex querying 
    becomes a performance issue, propose GraphQL pilot to Architecture Committee with 
    specific business justification.
    
    **Next Steps:**
    1. Review uki:organization:standard:api-design-principles-001 for REST requirements
    2. If GraphQL needed, prepare proposal using uki:organization:template:architecture-decision-proposal-003
    3. Consult with Security Team for customer data handling requirements

    - "moc:scope:customer-experience-tribe" 
    - "moc:domain:technical"
    - "moc:maturity:standard"
    
  escalation_guidance: |
    Your squad lead authority allows REST API decisions within tribe scope. 
    GraphQL adoption requires Principal Engineer or Architecture Committee approval 
    due to organizational impact.
```

**Example 3: Security Advisor Compliance Check**
```yaml
user_query: "Our payment processing API needs to handle European customer data. What compliance requirements apply?"

security_advisor_response:
  authority_context: "Based on your Senior Engineer role with Core Systems Tribe access"
  compliance_analysis_mode: "Multi-jurisdiction regulatory requirements"
  
  response: |
