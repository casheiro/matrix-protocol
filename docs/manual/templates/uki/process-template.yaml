# USAGE GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

# This template is optimized for:
# - Operational processes (daily/weekly/monthly activities)
# - Management processes (planning, review, decision-making)
# - Support processes (HR, IT, facilities)
# - Customer-facing processes (sales, support, delivery)

# Key principles:
# 1. Be clear and specific in step descriptions
# 2. Define roles and responsibilities explicitly
# 3. Include quality standards and measurements
# 4. Document exception handling and escalation
# 5. Plan for continuous improvement and updates
# 6. Consider compliance and regulatory requirements
