POST-MORTEM: PAYMENT SYSTEM OUTAGE
Incident ID: INC-2023-12-15-001
Date: 12/15/2023 2:22 PM - 4:45 PM EST
Duration: 2h23min
Impact: 100% payment processing unavailability
Estimated lost revenue: $45,000

==== EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ====

Payment system was completely unavailable for 2h23min due to cascading failure initiated by excessive timeout on Stripe gateway. Problem was aggravated by lack of circuit breaker and inadequate monitoring.

==== TIMELINE ====

2:22 PM - First Stripe timeout alerts
2:25 PM - Application started accumulating blocked threads  
2:30 PM - Database pool exhausted (max 20 connections)
2:35 PM - System completely frozen
2:40 PM - On-call team paged via PagerDuty
2:45 PM - Investigation started (Carlos and Pedro)
3:20 PM - Root cause identified (Stripe unstable)
3:25 PM - Application restart attempt (failed)
3:30 PM - Forced restart with kill -9
3:35 PM - Application up but still freezing
3:45 PM - Disabled Stripe, activated PayPal as primary  
4:00 PM - System stable, processing normalized
4:15 PM - Intensive monitoring started
4:45 PM - Declared complete resolution

==== ROOT CAUSE ====

1. Stripe API exhibited high latency (20-60s per request)
2. Our application doesn't have circuit breaker
3. Threads got blocked waiting for Stripe response
4. Database connection pool exhausted (blocked threads held connections)
5. System completely frozen

==== CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ====

- Timeout configured too high (90s)
- Lack of circuit breaker pattern
- Database connection pool poorly sized
- Monitoring didn't detect gradual degradation
- Manual failover process too slow
- Outdated runbook (still mentioned discontinued PayPal)

==== IMPACT ====

BUSINESS:
- 2h23min without processing payments
- 156 lost transactions (customers gave up)
- $45,000 estimated lost revenue
- 23 support tickets about "payment not working"
- Daily NPS dropped from 8.2 to 6.1

TECHNICAL:
- Database frozen (required restart)
- Corrupted logs (couldn't recover some)
- Redis cache lost (forced restart)
- Monitoring false alerts for 3h after resolution

==== IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ====

âœ… DONE:
- Stripe timeout reduced: 90s â†’ 30s
- Restart procedure documented and tested
- Alerts configured for latency > 10s
- PayPal failover tested and functional

==== PREVENTIVE ACTIONS (30 DAY DEADLINE) ====

ðŸš« NOT DONE (to this day):
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Increase database pool: 20 â†’ 50 connections  
- [ ] Health check that validates gateway connectivity
- [ ] Updated runbook with new procedures
- [ ] Thread pool utilization monitoring
- [ ] Load test simulating gateway failure

==== LESSONS LEARNED ====

1. Circuit breaker is CRITICAL for external integrations
2. Monitoring must include external dependencies
3. Aggressive timeout is better than high timeout
4. Failover should be automatic, not manual
5. Database pool needs to be sized considering blocked threads
6. Runbooks need to be living documents, not forgotten files

==== METRICS ====

MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery): 2h23min
MTTD (Mean Time to Detection): 8 minutes  
MTTF (Mean Time to Fix): 2h15min

MTTR Goal: < 30 minutes
MTTD Goal: < 5 minutes

==== ACTION ITEMS ====

HIGH PRIORITY:
- Pedro: Circuit breaker implementation (PAYMENTS-1567)  
- Carlos: Database pool tuning (OPS-445)
- John: Health check endpoints (PAYMENTS-1568)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- Ana: Load testing scenarios (QA-223)
- Maria: Runbook update (DOC-445)  
- Team: Post-mortem review meeting (schedule)

PERSONAL NOTE (Pedro): This kind of thing will happen again if we don't prioritize tech debt. System is too fragile.
