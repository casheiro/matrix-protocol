JIRA Ticket: PAYMENTS-1234
Title: Implement fraud detection system improvements
Status: In Progress
Assignee: Ana Santos (QA)
Reporter: Maria (PO)
Date: 02/24/2024

DESCRIPTION:
We had a 23% increase in chargebacks last month. We need to improve our fraud detection system.

Specific cases identified:
1. Same IP made 15 purchases with different cards in 2 hours (Friday night)
2. Customer used 8 different shipping addresses on the same day 
3. $12,000 transaction passed without review (our threshold is $5000 but didn't work?)

CURRENT ANALYSIS:
- $5000 rule not catching high values (BUG?)
- IP blocking not working properly
- Address validation too permissive
- CVV validation passed card with obviously invalid CVV (000)

PROPOSALS:
1. Lower threshold to $3000 (but might generate too much friction)
2. Implement machine learning (maybe too complex now)
3. Credit bureau integration (expensive)
4. Improve basic validations (CVV, address)

John (Tech Lead) commented: "$5000 threshold might be too high. Let's start with $3500 and monitor for 2 weeks"

Pedro (Senior Dev) added: "There's a bug in CVV validation. '000', '111', '999' are passing. I'll fix this week"

Carlos (DevOps) noted: "Fraud logs are too basic. We need better observability to investigate suspicious cases"

IMPEDIMENTS:
- We don't have structured historical data for analysis
- Credit bureau API not contracted yet  
- BI team doesn't have availability for fraud dashboard

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] Threshold adjusted and tested
- [ ] CVV validation fixed
- [ ] Audit logs improved
- [ ] Suspicious IP monitoring active
- [ ] Process documentation updated

TESTS:
- Test with invalid cards (CVV 000, 123, etc)
- Simulate multiple purchases same IP
- Validate alerts for risk team

COMMENTS:

Ana Santos - 02/25: "Started testing. CVV 000 is really passing. Absurd."

Pedro Silva - 02/26: "CVV fix ready. Now blocks: 000, 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999 and obvious sequences"

John - 02/27: "Pedro, don't forget to handle case where CVV is required field but customer doesn't provide (null/empty)"

Maria - 02/28: "Product questioned if low threshold will affect conversion. Can we A/B test?"

Carlos - 03/01: "Configured Slack alerts when transaction > $3500. Channel #fraud-alerts"

Ana Santos - 03/02: "Found another problem: customer can use same card with slightly different data (John vs Jon vs J. Smith) and pass validation"
