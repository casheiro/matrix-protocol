Subject: [URGENT] PCI DSS Compliance - 30 day deadline
Date: 03/12/2024 2:35 PM

Payments Squad Team,

PCI DSS audit is scheduled for 04/15/2024. I've identified some points that need to be fixed URGENTLY:

CRITICAL (deadline: 03/20):
1. Card data access logs are not being generated
2. Data encryption in transit not on all APIs (some still HTTP)
3. Default passwords in production environment (seriously, people?)
4. Administrative access without two-factor authentication

IMPORTANT (deadline: 03/30):
1. Process documentation outdated (wiki is from 2022)
2. Team training - nobody took the mandatory PCI course
3. Penetration tests not executed this year
4. Log backup not working for 2 months

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS:
- Test gateway SSL Certificate expired (not critical but ugly)
- Password hash algorithm is SHA-1 (vulnerable, change to SHA-256)
- Session tokens don't expire (configure 30min maximum)
- Database connection strings with hardcoded password in code (SERIOUS!)

PERFORMANCE NOTED:
Speaking of which, the payment gateway is slow. Transactions that used to take 2-3 seconds are now taking 8-10 seconds. This could affect user experience and isn't directly PCI, but you should investigate.

Also noticed that Stripe webhooks sometimes arrive duplicated. Don't know if it's their problem or ours, but could cause double-billing.

NECESSARY ACTIONS:
1. John (Tech Lead) - coordinate technical fixes
2. Maria (PO) - approve overtime if necessary  
3. Pedro (Senior Dev) - review all code that touches sensitive data
4. Ana (QA) - validate fixes and document tests
5. Carlos (DevOps) - infrastructure and monitoring
6. EVERYONE - take PCI training by 03/25

NON-COMPLIANCE CONSEQUENCES:
- Card processing suspension
- Fines up to $500,000
- Certification loss (impact on new customers)
- More rigorous audit next year

Certificate must be sent to compliance@company.com after completion.

If you have questions, I'm available on Teams or extension 4455.

Best,
Roberto Santos
Compliance Officer

P.S.: DevOps folks, the backup server has been alerting for 3 days. Not PCI but please fix it soon.

P.P.S.: Maria, that manual approval process for refunds above $1000 you implemented is helping a lot with compliance. Keep it up!
