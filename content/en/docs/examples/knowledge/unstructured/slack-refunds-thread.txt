Slack Thread: #squad-payments - Topic: Refunds Policy

[10:23] maria.po: folks, we got another complaint about refund timeframe. customer said 7 days is too short

[10:25] joao.techlead: our policy is 7 business days, right?

[10:26] ana.qa: yes, but competition gives more time. magalu gives 30 days, amazon 15

[10:45] pedro.senior: folks, technically we can process in 2-3 days, the problem is manual process

[11:02] carlos.devops: current gateway is slow indeed. stripe is slow, paypal is faster

[2 weeks later...]

[14:12] maria.po: guys, VIP customer wants 14 days. can I approve as exception?

[14:13] joao.techlead: you can, but let's review the general policy

[14:15] ana.qa: +1 to review. 7 days is too restrictive

[14:16] lucas.dev: I'm new here but 7 days is weird indeed

[1 week later...]

[09:33] roberta.qa: just tested refund and it took 5 days, not 7. is our SLA wrong?

[09:35] pedro.senior: depends on gateway. stripe takes longer

[09:37] carlos.devops: paypal is faster, 2-3 days

[09:40] joao.techlead: so we have different SLAs by gateway? this isn't documented

[09:42] maria.po: let's standardize this. proposal: 14 days regardless of gateway

[09:43] ana.qa: I agree. gives margin and improves UX

[09:45] pedro.senior: technically ok. just adjust code

[Later the same day...]

[16:22] lucas.dev: implemented automatic refund for values < R$ 100. ok?

[16:23] maria.po: you didn't approve this with anyone!!! could break accounting flow

[16:24] joao.techlead: lucas, any change has to go through review

[16:25] lucas.dev: sorry, I thought it was obvious improvement

[16:26] ana.qa: let's document the process better

[16:30] carlos.devops: rollback done, no impact on prod
