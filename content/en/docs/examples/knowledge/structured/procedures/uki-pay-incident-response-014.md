  ## Severity Classification
  
  ### Critical (P0) - Response Time: 15 minutes
  **Criteria:**
  - Payment system completely unavailable > 5 minutes
  - Revenue loss > $2,500/hour
  - Financial data breach
  - Confirmed double billing > 10 transactions
  
  **Escalation:** Immediate PagerDuty â†’ CTO notification
  
  ### High (P1) - Response Time: 1 hour
  **Criteria:**
  - Performance degraded > 50% baseline
  - Specific gateway unavailable
  - Error rate > 10% sustained 15 minutes
  - Fraud detection system down
  
  **Escalation:** Slack alert â†’ Team lead notification
  
  ### Medium (P2) - Response Time: 4 hours
  **Criteria:**
  - Performance degraded 20-50% baseline
  - Specific functionality affected
  - Webhook delays > 30 minutes
  - Minor data inconsistencies
  
  ### Low (P3) - Response Time: Next business day
  **Criteria:**
  - Cosmetic issues
  - Minor performance degradation < 20%
  - Documentation inconsistencies
  
  ## Response Process
  
  ### 1. Detection and Alerts (0-5 minutes)
  **Automated monitoring:**
  - Health check failures
  - Error rate thresholds
  - Latency SLA violations
  - Business metrics anomalies
  
  **Manual reporting:**
  - Customer service escalation
  - Business stakeholder reports
  - External vendor notifications
  
  ### 2. Initial Response (5-15 minutes)  
  **Incident Commander assignment:**
  - P0/P1: Senior developer on-call
  - P2/P3: Regular rotation
  
  **War room setup:**
  - Slack channel: #incident-{timestamp}
  - Video call for P0/P1
  - Status page notification
  
  **Initial assessment:**
  - Scope and impact evaluation
  - Resource allocation
  - Stakeholder notification
  
  ### 3. Investigation and Diagnosis (15 minutes - 2 hours)
  **Data gathering:**
  - Application logs analysis
  - Gateway status verification
  - Database performance metrics
  - Network connectivity tests
  
  **Root cause analysis:**
  - Timeline reconstruction
  - Change correlation
  - Dependency mapping
  - External factor evaluation
  
  ### 4. Resolution (Variable timeline)
  **Immediate actions:**
  - Circuit breaker activation
  - Gateway failover
  - Database connection pool adjustment
  - Cache invalidation/refresh
  
  **Permanent fixes:**
  - Code deployment
  - Infrastructure changes
  - Configuration updates
  - Process improvements
  
  ### 5. Recovery and Validation (30 minutes - 1 hour)
  **System validation:**
  - End-to-end transaction testing
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Error rate normalization
  - Customer communication
  
  **Monitoring intensification:**
  - Extended observation period
  - Additional metrics collection
  - Stakeholder updates
  
  ## Communication Templates
  
  ### Initial Notification (P0/P1)
  ```
  ðŸš¨ PAYMENT SYSTEM INCIDENT - P0
  
  Issue: Payment processing completely unavailable
  Started: 2024-03-25 14:22 UTC

  - Customer impact assessment  
  - Revenue/business impact calculation
  - Initial lessons learned capture
  
  ### Post-Mortem Meeting (Within 3 business days)
  **Attendees:** Squad + affected stakeholders
  **Agenda:**
  - Timeline review
  - Root cause analysis
  - Contributing factors identification
  - Action items definition
  - Process improvement opportunities
  
  ### Follow-up Actions (Within 30 days)
  - Technical debt reduction
  - Monitoring improvements
  - Automation enhancements
  - Process updates
  - Training needs assessment
  
  ## Runbook Integration
  
  ### Common Scenarios
  **Gateway timeout:**
  1. Check gateway status pages
  2. Activate circuit breaker if needed
  3. Enable failover to secondary gateway
  4. Monitor double-billing prevention
  
  **Database connection exhaustion:**
  1. Check connection pool metrics
  2. Identify long-running transactions
  3. Restart application if necessary
  4. Adjust pool configuration
  
  **Memory leak/high CPU:**
  1. Capture heap dump
  2. Analyze garbage collection logs
  3. Rolling restart with traffic distribution
  4. Deploy hotfix if available
