# MOC Governance and Policy Matrix

The **Matrix Ontology Catalog (MOC)** governance system establishes comprehensive organizational coherence through scope-based precedences and policy supervision. This framework ensures consistent decision-making while maintaining semantic elasticity and derived authority principles.

```

## Scope-Based Precedence System

### Hierarchical Precedence Framework

The MOC governance operates through three fundamental precedence dimensions:

#### 1. **Organizational Scope Precedences**

```yaml
organizational_precedences:
  scope_hierarchy:
    - level: "enterprise"
      priority: 1
      governance_rules:
        - regulatory_compliance: "mandatory"
        - strategic_alignment: "required"
        - risk_management: "critical"
        
    - level: "business_unit"
      priority: 2
      governance_rules:
        - market_adaptation: "flexible"
        - resource_optimization: "balanced"
        - customer_focus: "priority"
        
    - level: "squad"
      priority: 3
      governance_rules:
        - operational_efficiency: "local"
        - technical_excellence: "autonomous"
        - delivery_speed: "optimized"
```

#### 2. **Domain Knowledge Precedences**

```yaml
domain_precedences:
  expertise_hierarchy:
    - domain: "security"
      precedence_weight: 0.9
      escalation_required: true
      authority_validation: "mandatory"
      
    - domain: "compliance"
      precedence_weight: 0.85
      escalation_required: true
      authority_validation: "mandatory"
      
    - domain: "business"
      precedence_weight: 0.7
      escalation_required: false
      authority_validation: "recommended"
      
    - domain: "technical"
      precedence_weight: 0.6
      escalation_required: false
      authority_validation: "local"
```

#### 3. **Epistemic Maturity Precedences**

```yaml
maturity_precedences:
  validation_hierarchy:
    - maturity: "approved"
      precedence_score: 10
      change_authority: "committee"
      impact_assessment: "mandatory"
      
    - maturity: "validated"
      precedence_score: 7
      change_authority: "domain_expert"
      impact_assessment: "recommended"
      
    - maturity: "endorsed"
      precedence_score: 4
      change_authority: "peer_review"
      impact_assessment: "optional"
      
    - maturity: "draft"
      precedence_score: 1
      change_authority: "author"
      impact_assessment: "none"
```

## Practical Organizational Cases

### Case 1: Cross-Squad Security Policy Conflict

**Scenario**: Payment Squad implements 7-day data retention while Security Policy mandates 30-day retention for audit compliance.

**MOC Governance Resolution**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Conflict Detected] --> B{Scope Analysis}
    B --> C[Squad Level: 7-day retention]
    B --> D[Organization Level: 30-day compliance]
    
    C --> E[Local Optimization Priority]
    D --> F[Regulatory Compliance Priority]
    
    E --> G{Precedence Evaluation}
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[Domain: Security = 0.9 weight]
    G --> I[Scope: Organization > Squad]
    G --> J[Maturity: Approved > Validated]
    
    H --> K[Decision: 30-day retention wins]
    I --> K
    J --> K
    
    K --> L[Action: Update Squad Policy]
    L --> M[Audit Trail: Decision Record]
    
    %% Governance resolution - Functional colors
    style D fill:#A93226,stroke:#C0392B,color:#fff
    style K fill:#1E8449,stroke:#27AE60,color:#fff
```

**Governance Resolution**:
- **Winner**: 30-day retention policy (organizational level)
- **Precedence Applied**: P1 (Authority Weight) + P2 (Scope Specificity)
- **Rationale**: Security domain precedence (0.9) + organizational scope override
- **Action**: Squad policy automatically updated with compliance justification

### Case 2: Multi-Domain Knowledge Enhancement

**Scenario**: Technical and Business teams propose conflicting API versioning strategies during product evolution.

**MOC Governance Process**:

```yaml
conflict_resolution:
  participants:
    - squad: "backend_engineering"
      proposal: "semantic_versioning_strict"
      domain_ref: "technical"
      maturity_ref: "validated"
      
    - squad: "product_management"
      proposal: "marketing_versioning_strategy"
      domain_ref: "business"
      maturity_ref: "endorsed"
      
  governance_evaluation:
    domain_precedence:
      technical: 0.6
      business: 0.7
      result: "business_domain_advantage"
      
    scope_analysis:
      both_squads: "equal_level"
      escalation_required: true
      
    maturity_comparison:
      validated_vs_endorsed: "technical_advantage"
      
  resolution_matrix:
    business_domain: +0.7
    validated_maturity: +0.3
    cross_squad_impact: +0.5
    total_score_business: 1.5
    total_score_technical: 0.9
    
  decision:
    winner: "marketing_versioning_strategy"
    implementation: "hybrid_approach"
    governance_note: "Technical constraints as guardrails"
```

### Case 3: Temporal Precedence with Authority Evolution

**Scenario**: Original architect leaves organization; new team lead proposes architecture changes to established patterns.

**Governance Dynamics**:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OA as Original Architect
    participant TL as New Team Lead  
    participant MOC as MOC Governance
    participant MAL as Matrix Arbiter
    
    OA->>MOC: Established: "microservices_pattern" (approved)
    Note over OA,MOC: Authority: Senior Architect
    
    OA->>MOC: Departure: Authority transfer initiated
    MOC->>MOC: Authority validation: "derived_authority_principle"
    
    TL->>MOC: Proposed: "monolith_first_pattern" (validated)
    Note over TL,MOC: Authority: Team Lead (lower than architect)
    
    MOC->>MAL: Conflict: Authority vs Temporal precedence
    MAL->>MAL: Apply P4: Temporal Recency + P1: Authority Weight
    
    MAL->>MOC: Decision: Hybrid approach required
    Note over MAL,MOC: Rationale: Respect established + new context
    
    MOC->>TL: Approved: "evolution_strategy" 
    Note over MOC,TL: Gradual transition with architectural review
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setting Up MOC Governance

1. **Organizational Assessment**
   - Map current authority structures
   - Identify domain expertise distribution
   - Analyze existing decision-making patterns

2. **Policy Matrix Configuration**
   - Customize precedence weights for organizational context
   - Define domain-specific governance rules
   - Establish escalation paths and authority levels

3. **Monitoring System Deployment**
   - Implement automated conflict detection
   - Set up KPI dashboards and alerting
   - Configure audit trail collection

4. **Stakeholder Training**
   - MOC governance principles education
   - Precedence rule application training
   - Escalation process familiarization
