# Organizational Assessment

## Overview

The Organizational Assessment is an evaluation tool that determines your organization's readiness to implement the Matrix Protocol. This assessment considers factors such as knowledge maturity, governance capacity, and available resources.

## Assessment Objectives

### Evaluate Readiness
- **Knowledge Maturity**: Current state of knowledge management
- **Governance Capacity**: Existing approval and validation processes
- **Technical Resources**: Available tools and competencies
- **Organizational Culture**: Openness to change and adoption of new processes

### Identify Gaps
- **Process Gaps**: Where current processes are insufficient
- **Training Needs**: Competencies that need to be developed
- **Organizational Barriers**: Cultural or structural obstacles
- **Tool Requirements**: Technologies needed for implementation

## Assessment Dimensions

### 1. Current Knowledge Management
**Key Questions:**
- How is knowledge currently documented?
- Are there formal knowledge validation processes?
- How are contradictions between documents handled?
- What is the level of information dispersion?

**Maturity Indicators:**
- ✅ **High**: Centralized documentation, validation processes, versioning
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Partial documentation, some validation, controlled dispersion
- ❌ **Low**: Dispersed documentation, no validation, frequent contradictions

### 2. Governance Structure
**Key Questions:**
- Are authorities clearly defined by domain?
- How are decisions made about organizational knowledge?
- Are there escalation processes for conflicts?
- What is the level of process formalization?

**Maturity Indicators:**
- ✅ **High**: Defined authorities, formal processes, clear escalation
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Some authorities, informal processes, ad-hoc escalation
- ❌ **Low**: Diffuse authorities, inconsistent decisions, no escalation

### 3. Technical Capacity
**Key Questions:**
- Does the team have familiarity with versioning (Git)?
- Is there experience with structured formats (YAML, Markdown)?
- Are collaboration tools in use?
- What is the current level of automation?

**Maturity Indicators:**
- ✅ **High**: Fluent Git, structured formats, modern tools
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Basic Git, some structured formats, partial tools
- ❌ **Low**: No versioning, unstructured documents, manual tools

### 4. Change Culture
**Key Questions:**
- How does the organization react to process changes?
- Is there a culture of continuous improvement?
- Is there openness to experimentation?
- What level of resistance is expected?

**Maturity Indicators:**
- ✅ **High**: Embraces changes, continuous improvement, active experimentation
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Accepts gradual changes, some improvement, cautious experimentation
- ❌ **Low**: Resists changes, static processes, avoids experimentation

## Assessment Methodology

### Phase 1: Data Collection (1 week)
*[Detailed methodology under development]*

### Phase 2: Analysis and Diagnosis (3 days)
*[Analysis framework under development]*

### Phase 3: Recommendations (2 days)
*[Recommendation templates under development]*

## Assessment Tools

### Self-Assessment Questionnaire
*[Under development - interactive tool for initial self-assessment]*

### Interview Templates
*[Under development - structured script for stakeholder interviews]*

### Maturity Matrix
*[Under development - scoring and benchmarking tool]*

## Assessment Results

### Readiness Report
The final report will include:

1. **Overall Readiness Score** (1-20 points)
2. **Analysis by Dimension** with strengths and gaps
3. **Template Recommendation** ([Templates by Size](./templates/templates-moc-by-organization-size))
4. **Implementation Plan** customized
5. **Risk Analysis** and mitigation strategies

## Next Steps

After completing the assessment:

1. **Review Results** with leadership and stakeholders
2. **Select Template** appropriate based on diagnosis
3. **Plan Implementation** following [Detailed Phases](./templates/implementation-phases-detailed)
4. **Form Team** based on identified competencies
