  ## Zero Trust Security Architecture Standard
  
  ### Architecture Principles
  
  #### Core Zero Trust Tenets
  1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**
     - No implicit trust based on network location
     - Continuous verification of every transaction
     - Risk-based authentication and authorization
  
  2. **Assume Breach**
     - Design systems assuming compromise has occurred
     - Minimize blast radius through micro-segmentation
     - Comprehensive monitoring and incident response
  
  3. **Verify Explicitly**
     - All access decisions based on multiple data points
     - User identity, device health, location, behavior analytics
     - Real-time risk assessment for every access request
  
  4. **Least Privilege Access**
     - Minimum necessary permissions for required tasks
     - Just-in-time (JIT) access for elevated privileges
     - Regular access reviews and recertification
  
  5. **Micro-segmentation**
     - Network segmentation at granular level
     - Application-level access controls
     - East-west traffic inspection and control
